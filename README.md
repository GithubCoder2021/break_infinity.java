# breakinfinity.java
Break infinity ported into java. Cant use expressions yet. You can only set variables

This is just a porting test.
maybe logarithms were better.

Example
```
breakinfinity test = new breakinfinity("Number", 1 , 10);
System.out.println(test);
```
The first Parameter is the name of the variable, second is mantissa and third is your exponent in 10^x
The code above prints out 1.0e10.0 (1e10)

Operators coming soon...
